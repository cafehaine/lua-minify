# lua-minify

lua-minify is a Lua library to minify html5 and css3. It's written in pure Lua
5.3, and it's written using test-driven development.

The project's name isn't definitive, and might/will change, as there are already
a few projects named lua-minify.

# Current status

Pretty much nothing is implemented. Everything is still to do.
